# UX/UI Principles 

Here i will discuss some fundamental UX/UI principles that an application should follow. After explaining the principle I will then go onto explaining how our application follows these principles.

## Design should focus on an experience 

As a user you when using an application you don't really remember the information that the organisation provides but they do tend to remember the experience they have. So you need to make the user have a pleasant experience. 

The way our application provides this is by having an easy to use interface and just essentially providing the service it was made for. Which is to record videos. The user will be able to easily log in record a video and access that video using a special link that is sent to them. We don't bombard the user with loads of information. Just simple instructions on how to use the application. Leaving a better emotional effect on the user.

## People scan websites, they don’t read them

Expanding on the last point. If there is a big body of text it is high unlikely that the user will sit there and read and take in the information. So the application needs to be scannable where the user can just look over the page and know exactly what to do. 

Our application will have minimal text to allow the instructions to be clear and concise so the user knows exactly what to do. We will also rely on clear icons and headings so they can navigate through the app easily. 

## Users crave simplicity and clarity

Making the best first impression make or breaks the success of an application. As a new user it will take 0.5 seconds to decide if they are interested or not. They judge by the layout of the app, ease of use, colours and bugs etc. 

We have made it so that as the user clicks on the website they know exactly what we are about and what we provide. Then there is a recording button so that after they log in they are ready to go. 

## Know where to get creative and where to use common design patterns

You don't want to be too innovative where the user get's confused. For example links should look like links and buttons should look like buttons. 

For applicaitions we will use simple icons to direct users. these are commonly used icons like mic symbols and camera symbols to portray muting and camera off and on functions.

## Design to capture someone’s attention above the fold rather than design everything above the fold

There has been so many projects where if you were to visit the site you will see everything the website has to offer. So it more efficient to just have something little to show to grab the attention and then entice the user. Let them gander. 

Our application provides one main function and that is our main point so we should be able to deliver that to a high standard.
