# UX/UI Principles 

Here i will discuss some fundamental UX/UI principles that an application should follow. After explaining the principle I will then go onto explaining how our application follows these principles.

## Design should focus on an experience 

As a user you when using an application you don't really remember the information that the organisation provides but they do tend to remember the experience they have. So you need to make the user have a pleasant experience. 

The way our application provides this is by having an easy to use interface and just essentially providing the service it was made for.
