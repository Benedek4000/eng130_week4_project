# DB / #

- We will use SQL to query for data
  - Flat file database for recordings
    - No repetitions anyway due to location, time stamps
  - Relational database to store user information
- We will use (most likely) MongoDB for both databases
  - We have used it and linked it before so will be relatively easy to do

## Relational database / ##

We will use PostgreSQL for the relational database as it offers a lot of features like SQL querying, API support, migration to bigger databases and is supported on many operating systems
