Welcome to eng130 Video Recording app project. In this short introduction, we will inform you on how to get the website integrated in your system with simple steps (as long as our public server is running). 
## Running on localhost 

The list of requirements needed for this website is listed in requirements.txt, all you need to do is clone this repository into your local machine and `cd eng130_week4_project` to get into the folder. 
1. After that is done, run the installation by writing in the command line

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Once all is installed, run the app.py by either doing it through vscode or any other software or writing in the command line:

```bash
python app.py
```

**NOTE: If python doesn't work try python3**

```bash
python3 app.py
```

3. If everything runs as expected you should see this in the terminal

```bash
